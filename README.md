# PyNMRSTAR
A Python module for reading, writing, and manipulating NMR-STAR files. [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/uwbmrb/PyNMRSTAR.svg?branch=v2)](https://travis-ci.org/uwbmrb/PyNMRSTAR)

Python versions supported: 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5

### Want it faster?

Now there is a C extension that makes parsing and printing in NMR-STAR
format significantly faster. Simply

```bash
cd c
make
cd ..
```

and then use the library like normal to start taking advantage of the
speed up! If you don't compile the C extension the module will use
automatically use pure python implementations instead.

====

This module provides Entry, Saveframe, and Loop objects. Use python's
built in help function for documentation.

There are eight module variables you can set to control our behavior.

* Setting bmrb.VERBOSE to True will print some of what is going on to
the terminal.

* Setting bmrb.RAISE_PARSE_WARNINGS to True will raise an exception if
the parser encounters something problematic. Normally warnings are
suppressed.

* In addition, if you want to ignore some parse warnings but allow the
rest, you can specify warnings to ignore by adding the warning to ignore
to the "WARNINGS_TO_IGNORE" list.

Here are descriptions of the parse warnings that can be suppressed:

 * "tag-only-loop": A loop with no data was found.
 * "empty-loop": A loop with no tags or values was found.
 * "tag-not-in-schema": A tag was found in the entry that was not present
in the schema.
 * "invalid-null-value": A tag for which the schema disallows null values
had a null value.
 * "bad-multiline": A tag with an improper multi-line value was found.

* Setting SKIP_EMPTY_LOOPS to True will suppress the printing of empty
loops when calling __str__ methods.

* Adding key->value pairs to STR_CONVERSION_DICT will automatically
convert tags whose value matches "key" to the string "value" when
printing. This allows you to set the default conversion value for
Booleans or other objects.

* Setting bmrb.ALLOW_V2_ENTRIES will allow parsing of NMR-STAR version
2.1 entries. Most other methods will not operate correctly on parsed
2.1 entries. This is only to allow you parse and access the data in
these entries - nothing else. Only set this if you have a really good
reason to. Attempting to print a 2.1 entry will 'work' but tags that
were after loops will be moved to before loops.

* Setting bmrb.DONT_SHOW_COMMENTS to True will supress the printing of
comments before saveframes.

* Setting bmrb.CONVERT_DATATYPES to True will automatically convert
the data loaded from the file into the corresponding python type as
determined by loading the standard BMRB schema. This would mean that
all floats will be represented as decimal.Decimal objects, all integers
will be python int objects, strings and vars will remain strings, and
dates will become datetime.date objects. When printing str() is called
on all objects. Other that converting uppercase "E"s in scientific
notation floats to lowercase "e"s this should not cause any change in
the way re-printed NMR-STAR objects are displayed.

Some errors will be detected and exceptions raised, but this does not
implement a full validator (at least at present).

Call directly (rather than importing) to run a self-test.


Variables
----------

* `ALLOW_V2_ENTRIES`: False
* `CONVERT_DATATYPES`: False
* `DONT_SHOW_COMMENTS`: False
* `RAISE_PARSE_WARNINGS`: False
* `SKIP_EMPTY_LOOPS`: False
* `STR_CONVERSION_DICT`: {None: '.'}
* `VERBOSE`: False
* `WARNINGS_TO_IGNORE`: []

Functions
----------

### def `clean_value(value)`

Automatically quotes the value in the appropriate way. Don't
quote values you send to this method or they will show up in
another set of quotes as part of the actual data. E.g.:

clean_value('"e. coli"') returns ''"e. coli"''

while

clean_value("e. coli") returns "'e. coli'"

This will automatically be called on all values when you use a str()
method (so don't call it before inserting values into tags or loops).

Be mindful of the value of STR_CONVERSION_DICT as it will effect the
way the value is converted to a string.
### def `diff(entry1, entry2)`

Prints the differences between two entries. Non-equal entries
will always be detected, but specific differences detected depends
on order of entries.
### def `enable_bmrb_defaults()`

Sets the module variables such that our behavior matches the
BMRB standard. This is the default behavior of this module. This
method only exists to revert after calling enable_nef_defaults().
### def `enable_nef_defaults()`

Sets the module variables such that our behavior matches the NEF
standard. Specifically, suppress printing empty loops by default and
convert True -> "true" and False -> "false" when printing.
### def `validate(entry_to_validate, validation_schema=None)`

Prints a validation report of an entry.

Classes
----------

### class `Entry()`

An OO representation of a BMRB entry. You can initialize this
object several ways; (e.g. from a file, from the official database,
from scratch) see the classmethods.

Methods:

#### def `__init__()`

Don't use this directly, use from_file, from_scratch,
from_string, or from_database to construct.

#### def `add_saveframe(frame)`

Add a saveframe to the entry.

#### def `compare(other)`

Returns the differences between two entries as a list.
Otherwise returns 1 if different and 0 if equal. Non-equal
entries will always be detected, but specific differences
detected depends on order of entries.

#### def `frame_dict()`

Returns a dictionary of saveframe name -> saveframe object

#### def `from_database(cls, entry_num)`

Create an entry corresponding to the most up to date entry on
the public BMRB server. (Requires ability to initiate outbound
HTTP connections.)

#### def `from_file(cls, the_file)`

Create an entry by loading in a file. If the_file starts with
http://, https://, or ftp:// then we will use those protocols to
attempt to open the file.

#### def `from_json(cls, json_dict)`

Create an entry from JSON (serialized or unserialized JSON).

#### def `from_scratch(cls, entry_id)`

Create an empty entry that you can programatically add to.
You must pass a value corresponding to the Entry ID.

#### def `from_string(cls, the_string)`

Create an entry by parsing a string.

#### def `get_json(serialize=True)`

Returns the entry in JSON format. If serialize is set to
False a dictionary representation of the entry that is
serializeable is returned.

#### def `get_loops_by_category(value)`

Allows fetching loops by category.

#### def `get_saveframe_by_name(frame)`

Allows fetching a saveframe by name.

#### def `get_saveframes_by_category(value)`

Allows fetching saveframes by category.

#### def `get_saveframes_by_tag_and_value(tag_name, value)`

Allows fetching saveframe(s) by tag and tag value.

#### def `get_tag(tag, whole_tag=False)`

Given a tag (E.g. _Assigned_chem_shift_list.Data_file_name)
return a list of all values for that tag. Specify whole_tag=True
and the [tag_name, tag_value (,tag_linenumber)] pair will be
returned.

#### def `get_tags(tags)`

Given a list of tags, get all of the tags and return the
results in a dictionary.

#### def `nef_string()`

Returns a string representation of the entry in NEF.

#### def `print_tree()`

Prints a summary, tree style, of the frames and loops in
the entry.

#### def `validate(validation_schema=None)`

Validate an entry against a STAR schema. You can pass your
own custom schema if desired, otherwise the schema will be
fetched from the BMRB servers. Returns a list of errors found.
0-length list indicates no errors found.

### class `Loop()`

A BMRB loop object.

Methods:

#### def `__init__()`

Use the classmethods to initialize.

#### def `add_column(name, ignore_duplicates=False)`

Add a column to the column list. Does a bit of validation
and parsing. Set ignore_duplicates to true to ignore attempts
to add the same tag more than once rather than raise an
exception.

You can also pass a list of column names to add more than one
column at a time.

#### def `add_data(the_list, rearrange=False)`

Add a list to the data field. Items in list can be any type,
they will be converted to string and formatted correctly. The
list must have the same cardinality as the column names or you
must set the rearrange variable to true and have already set all
the columns in the loop. Rearrange will break a longer list into
rows based on the number of columns.

#### def `add_data_by_column(column_id, value)`

Add data to the loop one element at a time, based on column.
Useful when adding data from SANS parsers.

#### def `clear_data()`

Erases all data in this loop. Does not erase the data columns
or loop category.

#### def `compare(other)`

Returns the differences between two loops as a list. Order of
loops being compared does not make a difference on the specific
errors detected.

#### def `delete_data_by_tag_value(tag, value, index_tag=None)`

Deletes all rows which contain the provided value in the
provided column. If index_tag is provided, that column is
renumbered starting with 1. Returns the deleted rows.

#### def `from_file(cls, the_file, csv=False)`

Create a saveframe by loading in a file. Specify csv=True if
the file is a CSV file. If the_file starts with http://,
https://, or ftp:// then we will use those protocols to attempt
to open the file.

#### def `from_json(cls, json_dict)`

Create a loop from JSON (serialized or unserialized JSON).

#### def `from_scratch(cls, category=None, source=from_scratch())`

Create an empty saveframe that you can programatically add
to. You may also pass the tag prefix as the second argument. If
you do not pass the tag prefix it will be set the first time you
add a tag.

#### def `from_string(cls, the_string, csv=False)`

Create a saveframe by parsing a string. Specify csv=True is
the string is in CSV format and not NMR-STAR format.

#### def `get_columns()`

Return the columns for this entry with the category
included. Throws ValueError if the category was never set.

#### def `get_data_as_csv(header=True, show_category=True)`

Return the data contained in the loops, properly CSVd, as a
string. Set header to False to omit the header. Set
show_category to false to omit the loop category from the
headers.

#### def `get_data_by_tag(tags=None)`

Identical to getTag but wraps the results in a list even if
only fetching one tag. Primarily exists for legacy code.

#### def `get_json(serialize=True)`

Returns the loop in JSON format. If serialize is set to
False a dictionary representation of the loop that is
serializeable is returned.

#### def `get_tag(tags=None, whole_tag=False)`

Provided a tag name (or a list of tag names), or ordinals
corresponding to columns, return the selected tags by row as
a list of lists.

#### def `print_tree()`

Prints a summary, tree style, of the loop.

#### def `renumber_rows(index_tag, start_value=1, maintain_ordering=False)`

Renumber a given column incrementally. Set start_value to
initial value if 1 is not acceptable. Set maintain_ordering to
preserve sequence with offset.

E.g. 2,3,3,5 would become 1,2,2,4.

#### def `set_category(category)`

Set the category of the loop. Useful if you didn't know the
category at loop creation time.

#### def `sort_rows(tags, key=None)`

Sort the data in the rows by their values for a given column
or columns. Specify the columns using their names or ordinals.
Accepts a list or an int/float. By default we will sort
numerically. If that fails we do a string sort. Supply a
function as key_func and we will order the elements based on the
keys it provides. See the help for sorted() for more details. If
you provide multiple columns to sort by, they are interpreted as
increasing order of sort priority.

#### def `validate(validation_schema=None, category=None)`

Validate a loop against a STAR schema. You can pass your own
custom schema if desired, otherwise the schema will be fetched
from the BMRB servers. Returns a list of errors found. 0-length
list indicates no errors found.

### class `Saveframe()`

A saveframe. Use the classmethod from_scratch to create one.

Methods:

#### def `__init__()`

Don't use this directly. Use the class methods to construct.

#### def `add_loop(loop_to_add)`

Add a loop to the saveframe loops.

#### def `add_tag(name, value, linenum=None, update=False)`

Add a tag to the tag list. Does a bit of validation and
parsing. Set update to true to update a tag if it exists rather
than raise an exception.

#### def `add_tags(tag_list, update=False)`

Adds multiple tags to the list. Input should be a list of
tuples that are either [key, value] or [key]. In the latter case
the value will be set to ".".  Set update to true to update a
tag if it exists rather than raise an exception.

#### def `compare(other)`

Returns the differences between two saveframes as a list.
Non-equal saveframes will always be detected, but specific
differences detected depends on order of saveframes.

#### def `delete_tag(tag)`

Deletes a tag from the saveframe based on tag name.

#### def `from_file(cls, the_file, csv=False)`

Create a saveframe by loading in a file. Specify csv=True is
the file is a CSV file. If the_file starts with http://,
https://, or ftp:// then we will use those protocols to attempt
to open the file.

#### def `from_json(cls, json_dict)`

Create a saveframe from JSON (serialized or unserialized JSON).

#### def `from_scratch(cls, sf_name, tag_prefix=None, source=from_scratch())`

Create an empty saveframe that you can programatically add
to. You may also pass the tag prefix as the second argument. If
you do not pass the tag prefix it will be set the first time you
add a tag.

#### def `from_string(cls, the_string, csv=False)`

Create a saveframe by parsing a string. Specify csv=True is
the string is in CSV format and not NMR-STAR format.

#### def `get_data_as_csv(header=True, show_category=True)`

Return the data contained in the loops, properly CSVd, as a
string. Set header to False omit the header. Set show_category
to False to omit the loop category from the headers.

#### def `get_json(serialize=True)`

Returns the saveframe in JSON format. If serialize is set to
False a dictionary representation of the saveframe that is
serializeable is returned.

#### def `get_loop_by_category(name)`

Return a loop based on the loop name (category).

#### def `get_tag(query, whole_tag=False)`

Allows fetching the value of a tag by tag name. Specify
whole_tag=True and the [tag_name, tag_value] pair will be
returned.

#### def `loop_dict()`

Returns a hash of loop category -> loop.

#### def `loop_iterator()`

Returns an iterator for saveframe loops.

#### def `print_tree()`

Prints a summary, tree style, of the loops in the saveframe.

#### def `set_tag_prefix(tag_prefix)`

Set the tag prefix for this saveframe.

#### def `sort_tags(validation_schema=None)`

Sort the tags so they are in the same order as a BMRB
schema. Will automatically use the standard schema if none
is provided.

#### def `tag_iterator()`

Returns an iterator for saveframe tags.

#### def `validate(validation_schema=None)`

Validate a saveframe against a STAR schema. You can pass your
own custom schema if desired, otherwise the schema will be
fetched from the BMRB servers. Returns a list of errors found.
0-length list indicates no errors found.
